Started a Changelog

Only really goes back to yesterday though...
Character Sheets

Implemented the ability for a single command to roll a character sheet
Logfile

The bot now outputs info and warnings and critical errors to a logfile located at /var/log/DiceRollBot.log
ZeroDivisionError

So apparently that was never fixed before this point. I've gone and done some error handling for it.

Thresholds

The bot now supports pass/fail thresholds. Yes, I know the variable is misspelled, but I don't care.
Modifiers

The bot can now add a modifier to groups of dice.
Tallies

The bot now tallies all the rolls in a command, but correctly this time...
